Final Project Proposal
======================

Introduction
------------

The eGovernment Development Index (eGDI) is used to measure a country's willingness to employ ICTs in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations. The thought is, that the use of ICTs can provide the facility to offer more effective government services can be offered to the citizenry. Therefore, the citizens of a country with a higher eGDI should have a better quality of life than those with a lower eGDI.

The proposed project will seek to visualize the eGovernment Development Index Data over the years with a view to understanding the following: \* eGDI trends by country \* the relationship between the eGDI and other socio-economic indicators (for specific countries and in general)

Data

Socio-economic Indicators: <https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators>

These two datasets are to be combined and visualised

Technology
